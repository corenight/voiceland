# Voiceland

Real time communication platform over QUIC written in Rust.

## What is Voiceland?

Voiceland is a fast, simple and reliable real time communication platform that relies on QUIC for transport layer. Is still in an early development, so there's a lot of things to do.

The actual goal is to create a simple (really simple) server that's able to communicate *n* connections that can share audio and video with Opus and AV1.
